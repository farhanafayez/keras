# Keras repos

This repository contains Keras repos for different type of neural networks that I have been playing with.

## Tech
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) - an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - A neural network open source library.
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - A library that fits over tensorflow backend to make neural network work more easy. 

## Get it started

  1) Git clone the folder to your computer
  2) Run the jupyternote book from any repos you like. ( make sure you have either Anaconda or virtual env running jupyternotebook )
  3) Run each block of code to see what happens at each step.
  
## Break down

> ANN
A simple artificial neural network made to predict depending on the features presented.

> RNN
A simple recurrent neural network that predicts the google stock for the next day.

> CNN
A simple convolutional neural network that takes the cifar10 dataset which has about 10,000 pictures of different objects which have been cleaned and made to use for neural networks.
